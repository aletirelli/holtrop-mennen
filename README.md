# holtrop-mennen
Python script implementing Holtrop-Mennen's method for ships power prediction.

The algorithm is based on the article "An approximate power prediction methond by J. Holtrop and G.G.J. Mennen" published in: International Shipbuilding Progress, ISP, Volume 29, Nr 335, 1982. (https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:ee370fed-4b4f-4a70-af77-e14c3e692fd4?collection=research).

A separate file is dedicated to the Fn>0.4 version, I am looking forward to merge these two files.

Another version of Holtrop's power prediction is implemented following the new article published in 1994: Holtrop, J. (1984). A statistical re-analysis of resistance and propulsion data. International Shipbuilding Progress. 31. 272-276.
